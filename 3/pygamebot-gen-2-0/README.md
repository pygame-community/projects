# [PygameBot Generation 2.0: A revamped server bot for Pygame Community Discord](https://github.com/orgs/pygame-community/projects/3)

This page aims to document the current plans for the future version of `PygameBot` (formerly known as `PygameCommunityBot`), a bot used for managing and enhancing the Pygame Community Discord server. It will be a complete rewrite of [**`PygameCommunityBot`**](https://github.com/pygame-community/PygameCommunityBot) that aims to address its predecessor's known problems and limitations by starting with a modular, guild-agnostic design from the ground up, paired with many quality-of-life server management features and cool abilites.
